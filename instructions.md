# Steps

## Week 2

Now you have downloaded the template, you might want to approach working on your site in this order:

1. Look through the code and research any tags you aren't familiar with.
2. Create a stylesheet and add a simple rule (e.g. turn all the text red) to make sure the two files are linked up correctly.
3. Add your content, including images. Proofread and validate.
4. Turn on the border-box model in your stylesheet. [Use this blog post from CSS tricks](https://css-tricks.com/box-sizing/) to get the code you'll need. You're looking for the 'the current frontrunner for best practice'.
5. Use the pattern we learned today to make the About Us, Work Experience, Image Gallery and Contact form sections responsive. **Tip**: try adding the pattern to the `.container-content` divs to see what happens.
6. Check your work in the [Chrome Responsive](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/device-mode/) mode.
7. Work on your font sizing and font choice for your page. Add font sizes in rems ([Read more about rems](https://snook.ca/archives/html_and_css/font-size-with-rem)) to your headings/text you want to be smaller. Remember to keep it relative.
8. Have a go at adding some background colours to 'zone' the page. The CSS you need is `background-color:red` or similar. Add the background colour to the relevant sections using the right classnames as from the lecture.
9. Think about the white space on your page - the padding and margins. You might want to put more margins or padding around each section. Try a few different approaches and see what works, especially on the `div`s with background colours.

## Week 3

We'll go through the kind of thing you should be seeing after completing the list above in the lecture this week. After the lecture the next jobs are:

1. Add the max-width for images to your CSS.
2. Format your contact us form's labels. You could also add padding, font-size and other styling to the `input` and `textarea` elements on the contact form.
3. Use floats and media queries to turn the three image gallery images into a row of three across at the breakpoint you judge to be right.
4. Think about how you can use media queries in other places on your site with a mobile-first approach.
