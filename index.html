                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <div class="content">
                    <p>Hi, I’m Luca and I’m a 19 year old software engineering apprentice at the BBC, currently working in the
                        BBC Sport website team. As well as working I am studying towards a degree in Digital and Technology
                        Solutions at Manchester Metropolitan University, I attend MMU once a week and in the course we are
                        currently studying Web Development, Programming and Business.</p>
                    <p>I live in Bolton and I have supported the (not so) mighty Bolton Wanderers all of my life, being a season
                        ticket for the majority of it. My Granddad used to play for Bolton and even though I didn’t
                        quite follow in his footsteps, I have played on the Macron (formerly Reebok) Stadium twice now.</p>
                    <p>I am a huge fan of the game Overwatch, and in my spare time I have been building a website that hits
                        an API and can display any users stats that it gets back. It is build with node-js and I am looking
                        to use React in the future to improve it.</p>
                </div>
            </div>

            <div class="container-content">
                <h2>Work Experience</h2>
                <div class="content">
                    <p>I’ve been a BBC employee since September 2016 and have worked in the BBC Sport Web team since then. I’ve
                        really enjoyed my time in Sport Web as the job has involved a lot of front-end work as well as a
                        lot of behind the scenes back end stuff. </p>
                    <p>When I first started, the team were just finishing off a new horse racing experience for the website.
                        We have then moved onto a new football experience in which I have been involved with since the start.
                        At the start of the project I was involved in all the ideation sessions and have since moved onto
                        working on the actual product. </p>
                    <p> During my time in the Sport Web team all the coding I've done has mostly been in pair programming. This
                        is where a more senior developer pairs with me and helps me write code and work through the tasks
                        I get given but more recently I have been getting more of my own tasks to do.
                    </p>
                    <p>Before this job, when I was studying at college, I worked at an Italian restaurant called Café Italia.
                        I was a waiter/bartender/one time chef and I really enjoyed working part time there.
                    </p>

                            was running an event there and invited him, he is from Bolton orignally so he came. I wasn't
                            supposed to be there but my when I drove to pick my Mum up and take her home she rung me and
                            told me to come in. As I walked in the entrance he was walking out so my Mum introduced me, it
                            was one of the greatest experiences I've had to date.

                        <div class="image-caption"> This is from when my team got to the final in the local cup and got to play on the Macron (Bolton
                            Wanderers' Stadium). It was the second time I had played on the Macron yet this time meant more
                            to me, as I was only 6 the first time and 11 years later I was making my return. Due to an injury
                            to one of our players we got to have a kick around on the pitch for an extra half an hour during
                            which we played Headers and Volleys in front of an empty Nat Lofthouse Stand, this alone more
                            than made up for the 4-1 loss we succumbed to eventually.

                            place in Italy is definitely Rome, I love the old ancient Roman structures that are still standing
                            and the history, myths and legends that surround these places. For me the most impressive building/structure
                            I have ever seen in person is the Coliseum. It’s huge, intimidating and absolutely wonderful.
